Priority Queue: Insert from one end and deletemax/min from the other end
Operations: Insert, DeleteMax, RemoveMax
Applications: Huffman coding Algorithm, Dijkstra Algorithm, Prim's MST, Selection problem
Implementation: Unorderedarray, Orderedarray
				Unordered LL, Ordered LL
				Binary Search Tree, Balanced BST
				Binary Heap: 1) O(logn) for insert, delete and update
							 2) O(1) for deletemin/max

Properties of Heap:
1) Parent must be >= or <= it's children
2) All leaves must be at h or h-1 where h is the max depth of the tree

Binary Heap: Each node has atmost two children
