Advantages of LinkedList: 1) Constant time insertion and deletion from head. 
2) No need to specify the size initially as the size grows dynamically

Disadvantages: 1) No constant time indexing
2) Wastage of space


Circular Linked List applications: 

1) When sevaral processes are sharing the cpu, round robin algorithm for scheduling
2) Implementation of Stacks and Queues
