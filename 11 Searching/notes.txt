Searching is a fundamental problem in computer science. 

The three standard ways to search are:
1) Linear search(Sorted and Unsorted)
2) Binary Search
3) Interpolation Search

In linear unsorted search, we start from the starting index and traverse the 
entire array in the worst case where as in sorted case,
we only need to search until we encounter the element or value greater than the element. 
However, worst case complexity is O(n) in both cases

In binary search, we start with the midpoint and if the element is less than mid,
we search the left half or else we search the right half. 
Note that the array needs to be sorted in case of binary search.
The worst case complexity is O(logn).

In interpolation search, we start with mid which is closer instead of taking the midpoint like in binary search. 
The average case complexity is log(logn). However the worst case complexity is O(n).
