Greedy: This is an algorithm design paradigm. In this strategy, we make locally optimal decisions in the hope that it'll lead to globally optimal solution

Characteristics of Greedy Algorithm: 
1) Optimal Substructure
2) Greedy choice property

Examples: 1) Huffman coding algorithm
2) Dijkstra's algorithm
3) Prim's MST algorithm
4) Interval scheduling algorithm
