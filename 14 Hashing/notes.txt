Hash table: A simple implementation would be direct addressing in which each key is stored in an array 'key' and hence it can be retrieved
in a constant time. However due to limited memory, this is always not possible.

Hashing or Hash Function or hashCode: Maps the key to the location of key in the array
One simple way is to module divide key by the array length

Load factor = No of elements/size of the table

Collision resolution techniques: 1) Separate Chaining
2) Open Addressing

Three in open addressing:1) Linear probing 2) Quadratic probing 3) Double Hashing
