There are many algorithm design paradigms for solving problems. They can be classified as shown below:

1) Classification by Implementation: 

a) Recursion and Iteration
b) Procedural or Non-procedural(We ask for something without implementing it)
c) Serial or parallel or distributed
d) Deterministic or Non-deterministic(guesses the best solution using heuristics)
e) Exact or Approximate

2) Classification by Design Method
a) Greedy
b) DP
c) DC
d) Linear programming
e) Reduction
