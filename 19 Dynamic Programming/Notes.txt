Dynamic Programming = Recursion + Memoization

Characteristics of Dynamic Programming: 
1) Optimal Substructure: Optimal solution to a problem can be obtained by optimal solutions to subproblems
2) Overlapping Subproblems: There are common subproblems

Types of DP:
1) Top Down: First check if the value is there, if no then calculate it and save it 
2) Bottom Up: Calculate the smaller problems and save it, then recursively calculate the bigger problems
